The principles we follow in developing ActiveWorkflow are
**simplicity**, **practicality**, and **reliability**.
Below you will find an overview of upcoming features and
improvements we wish to carry out in 2021-2022.

### Roadmap for 2021-2022

* **Libraries**:
  * Helper libraries for creating agents in various languages using the
    [Remote Agent API](remote-agent-api). Currently there are libraries for
    Ruby and Python.
  * Client libraries (`activeworkflow-client-*`) in various languages for
    controlling ActiveWorkflow programmatically via the [REST API](rest-api).
* **New built-in agent** ('Merge Agent') that merges incoming messages based
    on user-defined keys.
* **More documentation**:
  * Tutorials about various ActiveWorkflow use-cases.
  * Additional deployment documentation, including discussions about scalable
    execution with docker.
  * How to write custom agents (using client libraries where available).
* **User interface improvements**, such as new icons, cleaner user settings
    panel, improved layouts.
* **REST API enhancements**:
  * Ability to create workflows.
  * Functionality to access the message log of workflows or specific agents.
* **Enhanced agent runner**.
